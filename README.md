# Super Pong Wars CGA
A variation of the "Pong Wars" concept that allows for some player input. Done using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Are spicy candies better than minty ones? Is hot better than cold? This game places the verdict firmly in your hands, allowing you to choose which side gets to plunge straight through the other's blocks. But is that always an advantage?

You can absolutely make your own version. I did.

## Instructions
The game is contained in a single file: `index.html`. It can be opened with any internet browser, and has been succssfully tested on Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Tor.

When the game is running, simply click the up and down arrows or type an acceptable value to alter each color's Super Factor.

## Notable Features
- Rather than passively waiting to see which color emerges as the victor, players can now adjust each color's Super Factor, which is simply the number of blocks a ball can pass through before bouncing off (random bounces inward notwithstanding). Set up an underdog and watch it triumph!
- I cannot legally claim that this program achieves "blast processing", but some coincidental resemblance may occur.
- Also features graphics inspired by the CGA palette.
- Completely lacking any audio whatsoever, so as not to distract the player from maximum intensity.
